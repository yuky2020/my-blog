# Why the Anne 2 Pro
i want to improve my writing speed and so i bought  a 60/100 keybord, i ended up with the Anne2Pro because of build quality and bluethoot compatibility
## Basic version 

![Basic version](images/2.jpg)
I choose the black version  with Cherry  MX  Brown and overall looks pretty solid and beautyfull, anyway it's for sure upgradable

## Teardown 
Let's start by removing keycaps

Remove the 5 T5 screw from the board then remove the board and the battery from the old case

The battery is fixed on the bottom of the case but with just a little pressure  comes out

For the case i choose a full resin case from kdbfans [LINK](https://kbdfans.com/products/alopow-resin-case-for-anne-pro-2?variant=39449105367179)
