 ### Pie Chart
 Very useful when we need to understand the relative proportion of each value in a data distribution,anyway data could be difficult to understand[1]

### Waffle Chart or Square Pie Chart
Usefull to get an high level view of contribution to a whole, used also for example by git hub to show per day contributions

### Spider Charts (Personal Favorite )
To visually compare three or more quantitative variables,the best option is to use a radar chart, also known as a spider or star chart.
The chart usually consists of a series of radii, each representing a different category, that splay out from a center point like spokes.[2]
The length of each “spoke” is proportionate to the value being compared. For each category, the spokes are then connected with a line of a designated pattern or color, forming a star-like shape with points equal to the number of categories.

This chart can do comparison between various  attribute at the same time and remain easy to understand and  eye-catching, is very used and usefull for exemple in benchmarking and performance analysis
